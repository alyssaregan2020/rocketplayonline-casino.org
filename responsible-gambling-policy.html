            <h1 class="mb-4">Responsible Gambling Policy</h1>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Our Commitment to Responsible Gambling</h2>
            <p>At <span class="accent-keyword">rocket play online casino</span> , our mission is to provide an exciting and entertaining gaming experience. However, the cornerstone of our philosophy is an unwavering commitment to responsible gambling. We recognize that for a small minority of players, gambling can cease to be a fun pastime and can become a problem.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to create a safe, secure, and responsible environment where you can manage your play and enjoy our games with confidence. We have implemented a range of policies and tools to promote responsible gaming and to provide support and assistance to those who may need it. We want your experience with us to be positive, and that means ensuring you are always in control.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Maintaining Control: Player Protection Tools</h2>
            <p>We strongly encourage all our players to make use of our player protection tools. These features are designed to help you manage your time and spending, ensuring your gambling remains within your budget and is purely for entertainment. You can set these limits directly within your account profile or by contacting our Customer Support team.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Deposit Limits:</h3>
            <p>You can set daily, weekly, or monthly limits on the amount of money you can deposit into your account. Once you reach your specified limit, you will not be able to make further deposits until the period resets. This is a fundamental tool for managing your spending when playing at the <span class="accent-keyword">Rocket play online casino real money</span> platform.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Loss Limits:</h3>
            <p>You can set a limit on the maximum net amount you are willing to lose over a daily, weekly, or monthly period. The system will prevent you from continuing to play once this limit has been reached, helping to protect you from chasing losses.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Wager Limits:</h3>
            <p>This tool allows you to control the total amount of money you can wager (bet) over a set period (daily, weekly, or monthly). It helps you manage your overall volume of play, regardless of wins or losses.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Session Limits (Reality Check):</h3>
            <p>To help you keep track of time, you can set a session time limit. Once the specified time has passed, a notification will appear on your screen, giving you the option to log out or continue playing. This "reality check" is an excellent way to ensure gambling doesn't consume more time than you intended.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Cool-Off Period:</h3>
            <p>If you feel you need a short break from gambling, you can activate a Cool-Off Period. This allows you to suspend your account for a short duration, typically ranging from 24 hours to 6 weeks. During this time, you will not be able to log in, deposit, or play, and you will be removed from our marketing lists.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Self-Exclusion:</h3>
            <p>For players who feel they are losing control of their gambling, Self-Exclusion is a critical and longer-term option. By activating self-exclusion, you are choosing to block your account for a more significant period, usually a minimum of 6 months up to several years, or even permanently. During the self-exclusion period:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your account will be immediately closed and inaccessible.</li>
              <li>We will take all reasonable steps to prevent you from opening any new accounts.</li>
              <li>We will remove you from all marketing databases and cease all promotional communications.</li>
              <li>We will return any remaining real money balance in your account to you.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Identifying a Potential Problem</h2>
            <p>Responsible gambling means knowing when to stop. If you are concerned about your gambling habits or the habits of someone you know, ask yourself the following questions honestly:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you spend more money or time gambling than you can afford or intend to?</li>
              <li>Have you ever lied about the extent of your gambling or hidden it from friends and family?</li>
              <li>Are you chasing your losses, hoping to win back money you have lost?</li>
              <li>Has gambling negatively impacted your work, studies, or personal relationships?</li>
              <li>Do you gamble as a way to escape from stress, anxiety, or other problems?</li>
              <li>Have you ever sold possessions or borrowed money to fund your gambling?</li>
              <li>Do you feel a sense of guilt or regret after gambling?</li>
              <li>Do you find it difficult to stop or control your gambling?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions, it may be a sign of a gambling problem, and we strongly encourage you to seek help and make use of our self-exclusion tools immediately.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Seeking Help and Support</h2>
            <p>Recognizing that you may have a problem is the first and most important step. There are many independent, non-profit organizations dedicated to providing free and confidential support to anyone affected by problem gambling. We highly recommend contacting one of them:</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">Preventing Underage Gambling</h2>
            <p>It is strictly illegal for anyone under the age of 18 (or the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction) to open an account or gamble at <span class="accent-keyword">rocketplay online casino</span> . We take our responsibility in this area very seriously.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Age Verification:</h3>
            <p>We perform mandatory age verification checks (KYC) on all customers. If we are unable to verify a player's age, their account will be suspended until satisfactory proof of age is provided.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Parental Controls:</h3>
            <p>We encourage parents to use filtering software to prevent minors from accessing online gambling materials. Software such as Net Nanny™ or CyberPatrol can help you protect your children.</p>
