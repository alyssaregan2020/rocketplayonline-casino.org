              <h2 class="mt-5">Introduction</h2>
              <p>Welcome to the <span class="accent-keyword">rocket play online casino</span> . This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website ("the Platform"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. We are committed to providing a transparent and secure online gaming experience, and this policy is a key part of that commitment.</p>

              <h2 class="mt-5">What Are Cookies?</h2>
              <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
              <p>Cookies can be categorized as follows:</p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These are temporary and are deleted from your device when you close your web browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These remain on your device for a set period or until you manually delete them.</li>
                <li><strong>First-party Cookies:</strong> These are set by the website you are visiting (in this case, us).</li>
                <li><strong>Third-party Cookies:</strong> These are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting, such as our analytics or advertising partners.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="mt-5">How and Why We Use Cookies</h2>
              <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience. Third parties serve cookies through our Platform for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>
              <p>The specific types of cookies we use and the purposes they perform are described below:</p>
              <h3 class="mt-4">3.1. Strictly Necessary Cookies:</h3>
              <p>These are essential for you to navigate the Platform and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as accessing secure areas of the website or processing financial transactions, cannot be provided. These cookies are fundamental to the operation of the <span class="accent-keyword">Rocket play online casino real money</span> platform, enabling secure logins, account management, and payment processing.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-4">3.2. Performance and Analytics Cookies:</h3>
              <p>These cookies collect anonymous information about how visitors use our Platform. For example, they help us understand which pages are most popular, how long visitors spend on our site, and if they encounter any error messages. The data gathered is aggregated and anonymous and is used exclusively to improve how the <span class="accent-keyword">rocketplay online casino</span> functions and to enhance the overall user experience.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-4">3.3. Functionality Cookies:</h3>
              <p>These cookies allow the Platform to remember choices you make to provide a more personalized and convenient experience. For instance, they can remember your username, preferred language, or the currency you use. This saves you from having to re-enter this information each time you visit.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-4">3.4. Marketing and Targeting Cookies:</h3>
              <p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited our website, and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers.</p>
